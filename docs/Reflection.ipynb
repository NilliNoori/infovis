    "### Reflection\n",
    "In preparing this datastory, we anticipated a straightforward relationship between economic prosperity and improved dietary habits, leading to better health outcomes. Our initial expectation was that higher GDP per capita would universally result in healthier populations due to better access to nutritious foods.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our analysis revealed a more nuanced reality. While it is true that wealthier countries generally have better access to a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fish, this economic advantage does not straightforwardly translate into improved health outcomes. The increased prosperity also brings about lifestyle changes that contribute to health issues like obesity and related diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paradox was an unexpected finding. It highlights the complex interplay between economic conditions and lifestyle choices. Prosperity improves infrastructure and supply chains, making healthy food more affordable and available. Yet, it also often leads to higher consumption of processed foods and decreased physical activity. This dual effect of prosperity necessitates a more holistic approach to public health strategies in wealthy nations, emphasizing the need to balance increased access to healthy foods with efforts to promote active lifestyles and limit processed food consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the reflection underscores the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing the impact of economic prosperity on health. It is not merely about the availability of healthy foods but also about addressing the lifestyle changes that accompany economic growth."
